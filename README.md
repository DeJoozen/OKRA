OKRA - Opwijk 🌿
A Website Project for My Grandfather

Welcome to OKRA - Opwijk, a website that I’m building at the request of my grandfather. The goal of this project is to create a more accessible, user-friendly platform for the OKRA community in Belgium, which currently has an official website that is difficult for elderly people—like my grandfather—to navigate. As I’ve just finished my first year in Applicable Computer Sciences, I took on this challenge to improve my development skills, despite not pursuing development as my primary field of study.

This project is currently a work in progress. While development is on hold for now due to other commitments, I plan to resume working on it in the future, as it aligns with my passion for web development.

📖 About the Project
OKRA - Opwijk aims to provide a simpler and more accessible platform for elderly members of the community, focusing on ease of navigation and clear, straightforward design. The website will feature important community information, updates, and resources in a way that is tailored to the needs of its users.

Features (Planned and Implemented)
Implemented So Far:

Basic homepage with a simple, clean layout.
A navigation bar to access different sections of the website.
Initial page structure for easy browsing.
Planned Features:

A membership form that notifies my grandfather when new members wish to join OKRA.
A contact page with easy-to-use forms for communication.
A calendar of events to keep members informed about upcoming community activities.
A news section to post important updates for members.
🚧 Current Status
The project is currently paused due to other priorities. However, I am excited to return to it and continue development, as I believe this project will help me improve my web development skills and make a positive impact on my grandfather’s community.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
This project uses the following technologies:

HTML5 for the website structure.
CSS3 for styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript for interactivity.
Potential future integration with Node.js or React.js for more dynamic features.
The website will be hosted on my homelab, a personal server I set up in 2024.
🙌 Why This Project Matters to Me
This project is special because it represents both my desire to help my grandfather and my passion for web development. I saw an opportunity to create a more accessible experience for elderly people, which motivates me to continue improving my skills in web development. I hope this project will be a useful tool for the OKRA community, and I’m excited to finish it in the future.

🚀 Future Plans
Complete and refine the current features.
Add the membership form and event calendar.
Host the website on my homelab for local access and possibly future public hosting.
Continue to learn and explore new web development technologies to enhance the website.
🤝 Contributions
While this is a personal project, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions. If you have ideas to improve the website or can help with any aspect of its development, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
